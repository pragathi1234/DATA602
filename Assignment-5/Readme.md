#### Analysis
This repository offers a regression analysis example based on the used car dataset. This should be used as a guide to what should be included in your analysis, as well as expectations for format and best practices.

#### Dataset Description
The data being explored comes from scikit-learn and statsmodel. It is a dataset containing attributes that relate to used car prices. 

#### Problem Statement
Based on used car price datasets, able to predict selling price for cars.

#### Interpretation
Got 97% accuracy with both train, test and full dataset. Found this is pretty good model as it has more accuracy rate for test data. Transmission and condition are most important attributes for predictiong selling prices of a car.

#### Results
We captured 97% of the variation in car values with a simple regression model. 

#### Predictions
On a test dataset, we were able to predict median values with an r-squared of 97%.
